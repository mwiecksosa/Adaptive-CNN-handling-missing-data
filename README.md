# Classifying Irregularly Sampled Time-Series using a Convolutional Neural Network with Adaptive Pooling
2019 Big Data Summer Institute at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor Department of Biostatistics in the Machine Learning Group directed by Professor Jenna Wiens and Shengpu Tang.

This project is the fruit of hard work by three undergraduate students: Yujuan Fu, Michael Wieck-Sosa, and Diego A. Moreno-Galv√°n. 

In this project, we created a novel one-dimensional convolutional neural network classifier architecture in PyTorch that takes advantage of irregular time-series and uses adaptive pooling layers. This CNN architecture was developed to use an ICU medical patient's vital signals and classify whether or not they would disease within the next 48 hours. 

See the poster and presentation for information about the project in this GitHub.
